# Sobel Edge Detector

## Description
This project contains a script to execute and visualize 
the steps of a Sobel Edge Detector (SED). A SED estimates
the gradient of each pixel in an image in order to
create an 'outline' of an image. 

## Installation & Use
1. Clone the repository by copying the HTTPS link into 
the IDE of your choice.
2. Add images to the '/images' folder (optional)
3. Change the address ```'images/YOUR_IMAGE.png'```
on line 5 in the file 'filter.py' to your image's location
4. Run the 'filter.py' file

## Edge Detection
Imagine you had an image where each pixel's intensity was 
defined by the function F(x). In order to find where the color
of that image was changing, all you would need to do is find 
where the change in F(x)was largest. Those places would be 
the outline of that image.
